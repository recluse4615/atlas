# Atlas

**DISCLAIMER - this game is VERY early in development, things will change and rapidly.**

A voxel exploration game built around satisfying mechanics, interesting locations, and customisation.

## Supported versions

Due to the use of `item_stack:set_meta("inventory_image")` in `atl_tools`, this game will only work in 5.8.0-dev and above. (NYI LOL)

## Getting started

1. Download the game
2. Launch the game
3. Start by punching some trees :)
